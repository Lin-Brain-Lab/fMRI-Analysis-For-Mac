<img width="1205" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-18 at 2 25 09 PM" src="https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/assets/157174338/6b64a7b0-14d5-4373-a74c-b7e02c6243b4">
</details>

2. Follow the steps from the [FreeSurfer T1 Reconstruction page](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/2.%20FreeSurfer%20T1%20Reconstruction.md) for local reconstruction. Note: For the file EEGFMRI_EMOCLIPS_S002_EEGFMRI_EMOCLIPS_S002.MR.RESEARCH_FHLIN.0009.0001.2022.06.06.17.47.47.272116.90047252.IMA
dicom number is 0009

# 1.2 Server T1 Reconstruction
1. Enter server
2. `cd /space_lin2/jdin`
3. `mkdir emoclips` make a folder for emo clips analysis
4. `vi emoclips_t1_auto_recon.script` make [emoclips_t1_auto_recon.script](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/emoclips_t1_auto_recon.script) to auto recon multiple participants
5. `screen`
6. `pwd` make sure you are in the correct path
7. `./emoclips_t1_auto_recon.sh` to run the script, if there is an error at this point, try `chmod a+x ./eegfmri_wm_t1_recon_all.sh`

# 2. fMRI SMS-InI Analysis
### 2.1 Initialize Pathing and Environment 
1. Follow the steps from the [SMS-INI EEG-fMRI Data Analysis](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/6.%20SMS-INI%20EEG-fMRI%20Data%20Analysis.md) page

### 2.2 Convert .meas to .mat Files
1. Follow the steps from the [SMS-INI EEG-fMRI Data Analysis](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/6.%20SMS-INI%20EEG-fMRI%20Data%20Analysis.md) page
2. When running the script [s1_smsini_ssvep_meas2mat.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/2.%20EPI%20Co-Registration/s1_smsini_wm_meas2mat_multi.m) make sure line 27 is calling MBrecon_VE `[ ref,EPInew ] = MBrecon_VE( [path_dat_source{f_idx},ref_files(i).name],[path_dat_source{f_idx},acc_files(i).name],0.0005 );`. If there is an error present at this step, make sure your MatLab startup.m file has the eva_toolbox initialize (if you do not have the eva_toolbox, download it from the server at /home/fhlin/matlab/toolbox/eva_toolbox). If done successfully there should be a .mat file for each run.

### 2.3 Create .mgh Files
1. Run [s2_smsini_ssvep_make_ref.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/2.%20EPI%20Co-Registration/s2_smsini_ssvep_make_ref.m), if done successfully, there should be a .mgh file for each run.
2. If EPI data is also collected, unpack the dicom files to create a f.nii file for each scan. Use these files to create another set of .mgh using [s2_epi_make_ref.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/2.%20EPI%20Co-Registration/s2_epi_make_ref.m) these .mgh files that are created based on EPI data as opposed to SMS-InI data. Use .mgh files created using EPI data to create the co-registration matrix rather than the ones created using SMS-InI data as EPI data allows for a more percise co-registration (otherwise, always use .mgh files created using SMS-InI data)
<details><summary>Details on Unpacking Dicom Files to Create f.nii Files</summary>
  
1. Download all epi data files (Ex. epi1, epi2, epi3) and add all data to a dicom folder in the following path: Users/jessica/data_analysis/emoclips/s010/fmri_data/dicom
2. `tcsh`
3. `source .cshrc`
4. `setenv SUBJECTS_DIR /Users/jessica/data_analysis/emoclips/subjects`
5. `cd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/emoclips/s010/fmri_data`
6. `mkdir unpack`
7. `cd unpack/`
8. `vi unpack.rule` and write the following for each dicom scan
```
05 bold nii f.nii
14 bold nii f.nii
23 bold nii f.nii
```
10. `unpacksdcmdir -src ../dicom -targ . -cfg ./unpack.rule` if done successfully, there should be a f.nii file for each scan in the path /Users/jessica/data_analysis/emoclips/s010/fmri_data/unpack/bold/005
</details>

### 2.4 Manual Co-Registration

3. Download the [bb_register_init.dat](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/labmanual/blob/master/scripts/bb_register_init.dat) initial registration matrix file and copy the contents into a bb_register.dat file for each run (Ex. bb_register_01.dat, bb_register_02.dat). Note: If there is EPI data, make a bb_register.dat file labelled after each scan (Ex. bb_register_05.dat, bb_register_14.dat). Make sure to change the subject ID to the one you are working on and add it to your subjects fmri_analysis folder
4. Download [s3_register_init_epi.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/2.%20EPI%20Co-Registration/s3_register_init_epi.m) and add it your subjects fmri_analysis folder.
5. Change line 3 to your subject ID and from line 8 to the respective registration and .mgh file for the run. Note, if you have EPI data, this is the only circumstance where you will use the .mgh files created based on EPI data.
```
% No EPI Data:
file_overlay_register='./bb_register_epi_01.dat';
file_overlay_vol='mb_run_1_ref.mgh';

% With EPI Data:
file_overlay_register='./bb_register_epi_05.dat';
file_overlay_vol='epi_032_f.mgh';
```
6. Change lines 13, and 16 to your subject directory and location of your orig.mgz and run, if done successfully there should be a Figure 1 pop-up, click on a region of the brain in Figure 1 and there should be a Figure 2 pop-up of the co-registration. Click the g-key then the k-key to have the GUI popup. You should then be able to move the registration to manually correct it. After you have corrected the co-registration, click 'Export' 
<details><summary>Example of Figure  1 & 2</summary>
Note: For better viewing, change the threshold max to 2. You can also click on and rotate Figure 1 to better adjust the co-registration in Figure 2, as the orientation of Figure 2 moves in relation to Figure 1.

</details>

7. In the MatLab command window type `r*overlay_xfm` the output should be a matrix as such 
```
    0.0420    0.9680    0.2479    6.8547
    0.0262   -0.2492    0.9681  -60.9387
   -0.9988    0.0342    0.0359  -22.3622
         0         0         0    1.0000
```
then copy this into your bb_register.dat file in replacment of the current matrix, it should now look as such, then save. It is also important that the two numbers after the subject ID are 5 (this is for the resolution of the image)
```
s001
5
5
0.250000
    0.0420    0.9680    0.2479    6.8547
    0.0262   -0.2492    0.9681  -60.9387
   -0.9988    0.0342    0.0359  -22.3622
         0         0         0    1.0000
round
```
8. Repeat steps 4-5 for each run (or scan number if working with EPI data)
9. In terminal `tcsh` then `source .cshrc` then `cd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/emoclips/s001/fmri_analysis` then `setenv SUBJECTS_DIR /Users/jessica/data_analysis/emoclips/subjects` then create a script `vi s001_bb_register.script` with the contents of this script being as such, to allow for all runs. 
```
bbregister --s s001 --mov mb_run_1_ref.mgh --init-reg bb_register_epi_01.dat --reg bb_register_epi_01.dat --bold
bbregister --s s001 --mov mb_run_2_ref.mgh --init-reg bb_register_epi_02.dat --reg bb_register_epi_02.dat --bold
bbregister --s s001 --mov mb_run_3_ref.mgh --init-reg bb_register_epi_03.dat --reg bb_register_epi_03.dat --bold
```
10. `./s001_bb_register.script` to run the the script (Note: if there is a permissions error at this point, try `chmod a+x s001_bb_register.script`)
11. Run the following lines seperately to check your results for each run in freeview
```
tkregisterfv --mov mb_run_1_ref.mgh --reg bb_register_epi_01.dat --surfs  --sd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/emoclips/subjects
tkregisterfv --mov mb_run_2_ref.mgh --reg bb_register_epi_02.dat --surfs  --sd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/emoclips/subjects
tkregisterfv --mov mb_run_3_ref.mgh --reg bb_register_epi_03.dat --surfs  --sd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/emoclips/subjects
```

### 2.5 Create .stc Files

12. Next, run [s4_smsini_ssvep_make_acc_surf.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/2.%20EPI%20Co-Registration/s4_smsini_ssvep_make_acc_surf.m) make sure that lines 15-19 have the correct register files (that you just updated the matrix of in the previous steps). Here you may need to run each scan/run seperately. Note, here you use the 'mb_run_1_ref.mgh' files (the ones created from SMS-InI data). If done successfully there should be a .stc file for the lh and rh for each run. Note: here you used the 'mb_run_1_ref.mgh' files (the ones created from SMS-InI data). If done successfully there should be a .stc file for the lh and rh for each run.

# 3. General Linear Modelling
### 3.1 Create Parameter Files With Clip Onset & Duration
1. Download [s5.1_corrected_onset.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/3.%20GLM/s5.1_corrected_onset.m) and add it to your subjects fmri_analysis folder. This script creates 3 .para files (one for each run with the naming convention 's001_emoclips_0002_clip_duration_soa.para') with the corrected trigger onset time. The first coloumn of the .para files is the time and the second is the EEG trigger. Use these trigger onset times to create parameter files that also consider the duration of the clips in the following step. Make sure that the arbritrary values given to the token are not also a value for one of your triggers (Ex. If the value of the sync token is 1e2 and you have a trigger denoted by the number 100, you should change the token to be 1.5e2 so it doesn't match the trigger number).
2. Download [s5.2_fh1_smsini_make_soa.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/3.%20GLM/s5_fh1_smsini_make_soa.m) and add it to your subjects fmri_analysis folder. This script creates three .para files (one for each run) in this script the clips are broken down into run number and category so their onset time and duration can be logged. The clip duration is derived from the edat files and the clip onset time is derived from the previously created .para files.

### 3.2 Create GLM .stc Files
1. Download [s6_fh2_smsini_soa_glm.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/3.%20GLM/s6_fh2_smsini_soa_glm.m) and add it to your subjects fmri_analysis folder. Make such the .stc files are correct (the 'fsaverage' ones) and make sure you are using the correct .para files the consider the duration of the clips. Also note that TR for emo-clips data is 1.5 (as seen in the MRI protocol under the acceleration scan, 'Contrast - Dynamic' then 'pause after meas'). Change the hypothesis at line 64 to your desired outcome. Run each run seperately and make sure to comment out trigger categories that are not present in particular runs (run 1 does not have non-social clips and run 2 does not have face clips). If done successfully you should have beta.stc and tstat.stc files for each run.

<details><summary>Details on How to Get Trigger Information</summary>
  
1. Trigger infomation can be attained from running [s5.1_corrected_onset.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/Emo-Clips%20Analysis/3.%20GLM/s5.1_corrected_onset.m) and looking at the output in the MatLab command window (here it tells you what triggers are present for which runs)
2. To decode what each trigger means, look to the stimuli computer where in coloumn T2_catname the number codes the stimuli category (Ex. 118 is food because it starts with an 11, 11_food). In the first coloumn, a weight of 1 means the stimuli is presented and 0 means it is not. The coloumn T4_eeg_tgr is the order of the stimuli presentation which is also presented in the .vmrk files (some subjects include a resting state so run 1 is resting state, run 2 correlates to clip 1 presentation and so on)

3. Create a [excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Lk_TqdeMh7ZaU759iuv-7DJTdt3ggmSmj4qzjTcwcQ/edit?usp=sharing) of a list of triggers and their category for easy reference.

</details>


<details><summary>Note on Troublshooting GLM</summary>
        
1. In the script read_erp_smsini_trigger_soa.m a token called 'newseg_token' is added to prevent the error "Unable to perform assignment because the left and right sides have a different number of elements" as a new segment is sometimes added into the data and the code does not know how to responed to this. Accordingly, line 73-75 is added to account for a 'new segment' in the data:
```
   elseif(isempty(mk_tmp{2})) %new segment, empty between comma in mk
                trigger{f_idx}.event(mk_idx)=newseg_token;
                trigger{f_idx}.time(mk_idx)=str2num(mk_tmp{3}); %data index for the trigger
```
2. Additionally, line 67 of the script read_erp_smsini_trigger_soa.m is edited to allow for the instances in the data where the MRI trigger is not denoted by R128, but rather V  1, this is done to prevent a later error in the script fmri_smsini_soa_gavg_glm.m "Matrix index is out of range for deletion" as the .para files were not correctly populated in the previous step.
```
 if(strcmp(mk_tmp{2},'V  1')) | (strcmp(mk_tmp{2},'R128'))
```

3. Some run's do not include a specific clip category; for intance, run 1 does not have any clips from the face category. This causes the contrast varible for the face column in fmri_smsini_soa_gavg_glm.m to empty, this causes later issues when populating the beta and t-stat .stc files. If this is the case, make sure to comment out this trigger category to avoid have a all 0 column in the contrast varible. When commenting out a trigger category also to make sure to update the hypothesis number as the number of tigger categories in glm_var has now changed.
