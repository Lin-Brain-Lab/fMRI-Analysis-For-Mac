EEG pre-processing includes

suppress gradient and pulse artifacts.
calculate event-related potentials (for event-related design).
To do EEG source analysis, follow the procedure here.

## 1. Create Evoked Fields 
1. Download [read_erp_041019.m](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/labmanual/blob/master/scripts/read_erp_041019.m) and add it to your subjects eeg_raw folder. This script calculates evoked potentials.
2. Change the header file to your .vhdr file location
```
headerFile = {
    '../eeg_raw/SSVEP_epi_1.vhdr'
```
3. Change the marker file to your .vmrk file location associated with your header file. It is important to have only one file listed as the script expects only one.
```
markerFile={
    '../eeg_raw/SSVEP_epi_1.vmrk'
```

## 2. Prepare Brain/Head Geometries
1. Open a new terminal window
2. `tcsh`
3. `source .cshrc`
4. `setenv SUBJECTS_DIR /Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects`
5.  `cd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects` to your subject folder
6. `mne_setup_mri --subject 180330_SYH` (there is a strong possibility that this file already exists)
7. `mne_setup_source_space --subject 180330_SYH --spacing 5` (there is a strong possibility that this file already exists)
8. `mne_watershed_bem --subject 180330_SYH` (there is a strong possibility that this file already exists)
9. `cd $SUBJECTS_DIR/180330_SYH/bem`
10. `ln -s watershed/041019_inner_skull_surface inner_skull.surf` (there is a strong possibility that this file already exists)
11. `ln -s watershed/041019_outer_skull_surface outer_skull.surf` (there is a strong possibility that this file already exists)
12. `ln -s watershed/041019_outer_skin_surface outer_skin.surf` (there is a strong possibility that this file already exists)

### High-Resolution Head Surface
1. `setenv SUBJECTS_DIR /Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects`
2. `mkheadsurf -subjid 180330_SYH` if done successfully, output should be "mkheadsurf done" and a lh.seghead file should be in /Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects/180330_SYH/surf
<details><summary>If Error "mkheadsurf: Command not found"</summary>

  1. `cd home`
  2. `tcsh`
  3. `source .cshrc`
  4. `cd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects`
  5. `setenv SUBJECTS_DIR /Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects`
  6. `setenv FREESURFER_HOME /Applications/freesurfer/7.4.1`
  7. `source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.csh`
  8. `setenv FSL_DIR /Users/jessica/fsl`
  9. `echo $SUBJECTS_DIR /Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects` make sure you are in the correct subject directory
  10. `cd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects`
  11. `mkheadsurf -subjid 180330_SYH` should now work
</details>

3. `cd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects/180330_SYH/surf` to the location of your lh.seghead file
4. `mris_convert lh.seghead lh.seghead.tri` if done successfully, output should be "Saving lh.seghead.tri as a surface in TKREGISTER space"

## 3. Co-register between MRI and EEG sensors
1. Download the digitizer folder
2. Download [eeg_source_coregister.m](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/Scripts/EEG%20Analysis/eeg_source_coregister.m) and add it to your subjects eeg_raw folder
3. Change line 4, 7, 8, and 9 to your subject ID, and line 12 and 13 to the name of your .eps and .ela files in your digitizer folder then run
4. If done successfully, there should be a figure 1 pop-up of a head model

5. Click "k" to enable the manual registration GUI to move the electrodes around the head. Upon completing the registration, click the "Export + Save" button, select the fwd_prep_041618.mat file which is the output_name found in line 16, to save the registered electrode locations to the matlab data file. Registered electrode locations will be also exported as the variables, 'points' should in the matlab environment

6. Download [show_eeg_mri_coregister.m](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/labmanual/blob/master/scripts/show_eeg_mri_coregister.m) and add it to your subjects eeg_raw folder. This script displays the results of electrode co-registration.
7. Change line 3 to your subject directory `setenv('SUBJECTS_DIR','/Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects/');`
8. Change line 6 to the location of your 5-src.fif file `file_source_fif='/Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects/180330_SYH/bem/180330_SYH-5-src.fif';`
9. Change line 8 to the location of your lh.white file `surfin_lh='/Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects/180330_SYH/surf/lh.white';`
10. Change line 9 to the location of your rh.white file `surfin_lh='/Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects/180330_SYH/surf/rh.white';`
11. Change line 10 to the location of your outer_skin_surface file `surf_outer_skin='/Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects/180330_SYH/bem/watershed/180330_SYH_outer_skin_surface';`
12. Change line 11 to the location of your outer_skull_surface file `surf_outer_skull='/Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects/180330_SYH/bem/watershed/180330_SYH_outer_skull_surface';`
13. Change line 12 to the location of your inner_skull_surface file `surf_inner_skull='/Users/jessica/data_analysis/eegfmri/subjects/180330_SYH/bem/watershed/180330_SYH_inner_skull_surface';`
14. Change line 15 to the output name from the previous step `eeg_output_name='fwd_prep_041618.mat';`

### Examine Evoked Fields on a Head Model
15. Download [show_erp_scalp.m](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/labmanual/blob/master/scripts/show_erp_scalp.m) and add it to your subjects eeg_raw folder. Change all variable names from `erp_avg` to `erp` (this step should only be done when you have the eeg_fwd_prep_042319.mat file)
