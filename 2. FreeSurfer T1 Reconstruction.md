# FreeSurfer-T1-Reconstruction-For-Mac-Locally

1. To begin you should have the following folder path for your subject

3. `tcsh` 

4. `source .cshrc`

5. Download the dicom folder to your drive from the subject folder located on the server. (EX. home/fhlin/lin2/fhlin/eegmri_wm/subjects/s004/mri/orig/dicom)

6. Make a folder path as follows: Subjects/s004/mri/orig add the dicom folder into the orig folder 

7. `mri_info` checks if all freesurfer items are there
8. `setenv SUBJECTS_DIR $PWD`
9. `setenv SUBJECTS_DIR /Users/jessica/data_analysis/seeg/subjects` set your subject directory
10. `echo $SUBJECTS_DIR` sees what path your subjects are in 
11. `cd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/seeg/subjects/s025/mri/orig` get into right directory in orig folder
12. `mkdir unpack` creates empty folder called unpack (in orig folder)
13. `cd unpack/`
14. `vi unpack.rule` makes a file called unpack.rule, enter "37 3danat COR blah" (number changes based on dicom scan)
15. `unpacksdcmdir -src ../dicom -targ . -scanonly ./info`
16. `mri_convert -all-info`
17. `unpacksdcmdir -src ../dicom -targ . -cfg ./unpack.rule` make sure you are in the unpack folder (this step may take some time) 
18. `cd ../` make sure in orig file for next step (going back one folder) 
19. `mri_convert unpack/3danat/037/COR-.info ./001.mgz` after this step there should be a 001.mgz in the orig folder
20. `recon-all` this step will take about 10 hours to complete the whole processing

### Alternate Steps if Error Present at Step 17
#### Using Mango

1. Go to Mango and open the dicom folder of your subject
2. File save as .nii.gz file into your orig folder
3. `mri_convert EEGFMRI_WM_S004.nii.gz 001.mgz` in orig file, converts file to 001.mgz
4. `cd ../` make sure in orig file for next step (going back one folder)
5. `mri_convert unpack/3danat/037/COR-.info ./001.mgz` after this step there should be a 001.mgz in the orig folder
6. `recon-all`

#### Using mri_convert 
1. `mri_convert ../dicom/EEGFMRI_WM_S004.MR.RESEARCH_FHLIN.0037.0001.2023.02.24.17.53.54.227018.233311136.IMA -ot COR -o c` converts file (which can be copied from error message in setp 17) to ‘c’
2. `cd c`
3. `ls` to check if all COR files are there
4. `cd ..` to go back to unpack folder 
5. `mv c 037` to rename folder 
6. `ls` to check if folder named 037 is in unpack folder
7. `mkdir 3danat` makes folder 
8. `mv 037 3danat/`
9. `ls` to see if 3danat folder is there
10. `mri_convert 3danat/037/COR-.info 001.mgz`
11. `ls` to see if 001.mgz file is there
12. `cd ../` make sure in orig file for next step (going back one folder)
13. `mri_convert unpack/3danat/037/COR-.info ./001.mgz` after this step there should be a 001.mgz in the orig folder
14. `recon-all`
