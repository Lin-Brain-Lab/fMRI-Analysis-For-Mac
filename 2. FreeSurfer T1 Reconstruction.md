# FreeSurfer-T1-Reconstruction-For-Mac-Locally
1. `tcsh` 
2. `source .cshrc`
3. Download the dicom folder to your drive from the subject folder located on the server. (EX. home/fhlin/lin2/fhlin/eegmri_wm/subjects/s004/mri/orig/dicom)
4. Add the dicom folder to your subjects orig folder, you should have the following folder path for your subject

</details>

5. `mri_info` checks if all freesurfer items are there
6. `setenv SUBJECTS_DIR $PWD`
7. `setenv SUBJECTS_DIR /Users/jessica/data_analysis/seeg/subjects` set your subject directory
8. `echo $SUBJECTS_DIR` sees what path your subjects are in 
9. `cd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/seeg/subjects/s004/mri/orig` get into right directory in orig folder
10. `mkdir unpack` creates empty folder called unpack (in orig folder)
11. `cd unpack/`
12. `vi unpack.rule` makes a file called unpack.rule, enter "37 3danat COR blah" (number changes based on dicom scan, in this case is it 37)
13. `unpacksdcmdir -src ../dicom -targ . -scanonly ./info`
14. `mri_convert -all-info`
15. `unpacksdcmdir -src ../dicom -targ . -cfg ./unpack.rule` make sure you are in the unpack folder (this step may take some time) 
16. `cd ../` make sure in orig file for next step (going back one folder) 
17. `mri_convert unpack/3danat/037/COR-.info ./001.mgz` this step converts COR files into a 001.mgz file in the orig folder (number changes based on dicom scan, in this case is it 37. Leading zeros should not be added in the unpack.rule, EX. if dicom number is 0037, only put 37)
18. `cd /Users/jessica/data_analysis/seeg/subjects/s004` make sure your are in the subjects folder
19. `recon-all -subjid s004 all-` change based on subject ID, this step will take about 10 hours to complete the whole processing

### Alternate Steps if Error Present at Step 15
#### Using Mango
1. Go to Mango and open the dicom folder of your subject
2. File save as .nii.gz file into your orig folder
3. `mri_convert EEGFMRI_WM_S004.nii.gz 001.mgz` in orig file, converts file to 001.mgz
4. `cd ../` make sure in orig file for next step (going back one folder)
5. `mri_convert unpack/3danat/037/COR-.info ./001.mgz` after this step there should be a 001.mgz in the orig folder
6. `recon-all -subjid s004 all-` change based on subject ID

#### Using mri_convert 
1. `mri_convert ../dicom/EEGFMRI_WM_S004.MR.RESEARCH_FHLIN.0037.0001.2023.02.24.17.53.54.227018.233311136.IMA -ot COR -o c` converts file (which can be copied from error message in setp 17) to ‘c’
2. `cd c`
3. `ls` to check if all COR files are there
4. `cd ..` to go back to unpack folder 
5. `mv c 037` to rename folder 
6. `ls` to check if folder named 037 is in unpack folder
7. `mkdir 3danat` makes folder 
8. `mv 037 3danat/`
9. `ls` to see if 3danat folder is there
10. `mri_convert 3danat/037/COR-.info 001.mgz`
11. `ls` to see if 001.mgz file is there
12. `cd ../` make sure in orig file for next step (going back one folder)
13. `mri_convert unpack/3danat/037/COR-.info ./001.mgz` after this step there should be a 001.mgz in the orig folder
14. `recon-all -subjid s004 all-` change based on subject ID
