# fMRI Group-Level Analysis
## Examine Individual's Responses
>[!NOTE]
> Begin analysis by starting with steps from the [Event-Related fMRI Analysis page](https://github.com/Lin-Brain-Lab/fMRI-Analysis-For-Mac/blob/main/fMRI%20Event-Related%20Analysis.md)

1. Download [show_individual_surf](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/labmanual/blob/master/scripts/show_individual_surf_031324.m) and add to your fhlin_toolbox/group_level_analysis folder and open in MatLab
2. Make a folder /Users/jessica/data_analysis/seeg/group_level_analysis_s025_s031_s032_z034/Individual and go to this directory in MatLab
3. List starting from line 4 the subjects you want to include
4. Change line 35 to your root directory `root_dir='/Users/jessica/data_analysis/seeg';`
5. Change line 49 to the location of the stc files for your subjects `'%s/%s/fmri_data/unpack/ %s-%s.stc'`
6. If done successfully, you should have 3 images for each subject ("A" for audio, "V" for visual, and "AV" for audio-visual) in the folder directory you choose

## Calculate Group-Level Activation
1. Download [average_surf change lines](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/labmanual/blob/master/scripts/average_surf_031324.m) and add to your fhlin_toolbox/group_level_analysis folder and open in MatLab
2. Make a folder /Users/jessica/data_analysis/seeg/group_level_analysis_s025_s031_s032_z034/Average and go to this directory in MatLab
3. List starting from line 4 the subjects you want to include
4. Change line 35 to your root directory `root_dir='/Users/jessica/data_analysis/seeg';`
5. Change line 49 to the location of the stc files for your subjects `'%s/%s/fmri_data/unpack/%s-%s.stc'`
6. Change line 61 to the location you want the images `'%s/group_level_analysis_s025_s031_s032_z034/Average/fmri_surf_%s_average.png'`
7. If done successfully, you should have 3 images (average of "A", "V", and "AV") in the average folder
